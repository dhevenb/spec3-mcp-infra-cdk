# Product Context: Spec3 MCP Infrastructure CDK

## Problem Statement

Deploying serverless MCP infrastructure manually is error-prone, time-consuming, and difficult to reproduce across environments. Traditional infrastructure management lacks version control, environment consistency, and automated deployment capabilities.

## Solution Approach

Use AWS CDK with TypeScript to provide:
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Version-controlled, reproducible infrastructure
- **Environment Consistency**: Identical deployments across dev/staging/prod
- **Automated Deployment**: Single command infrastructure deployment
- **Resource Management**: Proper lifecycle management of AWS resources

## Target Users

### Primary Users
- **DevOps Engineers**: Responsible for infrastructure deployment and management
- **Backend Developers**: Need reliable, consistent deployment environments
- **Platform Engineers**: Building reusable infrastructure patterns
- **Site Reliability Engineers**: Monitoring and maintaining deployed infrastructure

### Use Cases
1. **Development Environment**: Quick setup of local development infrastructure
2. **Staging Deployment**: Testing infrastructure changes before production
3. **Production Deployment**: Reliable, automated production infrastructure
4. **Environment Scaling**: Adding new environments or regions

## User Experience Goals

### For DevOps Engineers
- Simple CDK commands for deployment
- Clear error messages and rollback procedures
- Environment-specific configuration management
- Resource visibility and monitoring

### For Backend Developers
- Transparent infrastructure deployment
- Consistent development environments
- Fast iteration on infrastructure changes
- Clear documentation of AWS resources

### For Platform Engineers
- Reusable CDK constructs and patterns
- Standardized infrastructure templates
- Easy integration with CI/CD pipelines
- Comprehensive resource tagging and organization

## Success Metrics

1. **Deployment Success**: 100% successful CDK deployments
2. **Deployment Speed**: < 5 minutes for infrastructure deployment
3. **Environment Consistency**: Identical resources across environments
4. **Resource Cost**: Optimized AWS resource usage
5. **Developer Productivity**: < 2 minutes to set up new environment

## Value Proposition

- **Reduced Deployment Risk**: Automated, tested infrastructure deployment
- **Faster Development**: Quick environment setup and iteration
- **Better Consistency**: Identical infrastructure across environments
- **Cost Optimization**: Proper resource sizing and lifecycle management
- **Improved Reliability**: Infrastructure version control and rollback capabilities

## Infrastructure Requirements

### AWS Services
- **AWS Lambda**: Serverless compute for MCP servers
- **IAM**: Identity and access management
- **CloudWatch**: Logging and monitoring
- **S3**: Asset storage for CDK deployments (implicit)

### Deployment Targets
- **Development**: Local development and testing
- **Staging**: Pre-production validation
- **Production**: Live MCP infrastructure

### Integration Points
- **Lambda Workspace**: Source code and dependencies
- **AWS Account**: Target deployment environment
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated deployment triggers (future)
