# Project Brief: Spec3 MCP Infrastructure CDK

## Project Overview

The Spec3 MCP Infrastructure CDK is the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) component that deploys and manages AWS resources for the Spec3 MCP serverless infrastructure. This TypeScript CDK project provides automated, reproducible deployment of Lambda functions and supporting AWS services.

## Core Objectives

1. **Infrastructure as Code**: Manage all AWS resources through TypeScript CDK constructs
2. **Reproducible Deployments**: Consistent infrastructure across environments (dev/staging/prod)
3. **Serverless Architecture**: Deploy Lambda functions with minimal infrastructure overhead
4. **Environment Management**: Support multiple deployment environments with configuration isolation

## Project Scope

### In Scope
- AWS Lambda function deployment and configuration
- IAM roles and policies for Lambda execution
- Environment-specific configuration management
- CDK stack organization and construct design
- Asset bundling for Python Lambda functions
- CloudWatch logging integration

### Out of Scope (Initially)
- API Gateway configuration
- VPC and network security setup
- Advanced monitoring and alerting
- Multi-region deployment
- Custom CloudFormation resources
- CI/CD pipeline integration

## Success Criteria

1. **Successful Deployment**: CDK stack deploys without errors
2. **Functional Lambda**: Deployed Lambda function responds to MCP requests
3. **Environment Isolation**: Multiple environments deploy independently
4. **Resource Management**: Proper AWS resource lifecycle management

## Key Constraints

- Must use AWS CDK with TypeScript
- Must support Python 3.11 Lambda runtime
- Must integrate with spec3-mcp-lambda workspace
- Must provide environment-specific configuration
- Must follow AWS best practices for security and cost

## Infrastructure Architecture

The CDK project consists of:
1. **Main Stack** (`Spec3McpInfraCdk`): Entry point construct
2. **Lambda Stack** (`LambdaStack`): Dedicated Lambda resources
3. **Asset Bundling**: Python dependency management
4. **Environment Configuration**: Stage-based deployment settings

## Integration with Application Code

The CDK workspace is tightly integrated with the spec3-mcp-lambda workspace:
- **Source Code**: Bundles Python code from Lambda workspace
- **Dependencies**: Installs Python packages from requirements.txt
- **Handler Path**: References specific Python handler modules
- **Deployment**: Single command deploys both infrastructure and application
